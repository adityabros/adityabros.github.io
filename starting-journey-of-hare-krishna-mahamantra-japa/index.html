	<h3>Quest for Truth</h3>
	<p>A brief introduction about Myself, I am a software engineer by profession, born and brought up in India. Yes, The second most populous country in the World which is running perfectly fine and people are so awesome here.</p>
	<p>After a few years of my birth, I was admitted into an English medium school which was typically trending in those times to get high valuable Internation knowledge about the world and everything. I was unaware of Vedas, Puranas, etc and was only told to just pray to god without any reason. Just pray and was told to do good things. There was so much ambiguity about god in the information given by my parents as the information was too little and I was unfortunate that nobody in my House was there who had read Bhagavad Gita but they believed in Good Karma and was into very Hard Work.</p>
	<p>The best thing that was given to me by God was my mom who is a very good Vaishnav and so I was fortunate to get a vegetarian diet right since my birth and so I was protected by default from the Tamasic Foods. Tea was unfortunately prevalent in my house which is Rajasic.</p>

	<p>So life just started and I was into it and so came its harsh attacks on me. Just from the beginning of my life I was attacked by various other people for almost no reason and I never bothered them, Just randomly they chose me, I didn't understand this at that time but now I can tell that due the effect of Maya they were themselves not happy in their life and you can see this in the world that a person who is happy in his life, for eg- suppose somebody won a lottery today or something great happened in his life. Just go and see him, he will be totally positive and he will not bother anyone and will not find mistakes in other's work or complaint about something, Everything is good for him, but soon after some time these things vanish and we need another good kick to spike our happiness, This was my observation and so I kept asking myself this question, When will I be permanently happy ?.</p>

	<p>One thing that I observed was that We all need a reason to be happy. We cannot be just happy for no reason. Like for eg - Someone is happy because he got a job, getting a nice car, House, Winning Gold Medal in the Olympics, etc but there is one thing in these things that they are just temporary happiness, It stays for some time and then we got bored from it and we want something else or something more and so the endless cycle goes on and on. We get more distress and sadness than happiness If we carefully observe this thing in life. For eg- Thousands of people compete in Olympics in various games but only one gets a Gold medal in a particular event and so many people see failure and only one person sees that victory but this leaves so many people filled with unhappiness and so it seemed unfair to me. I thought that why is it so? Why is the world so unfair. I was told that God was kind and merciful but then why he created a world where people are in so much pain which is endless, People from all age groups are suffering from various types of illnesses and diseases and they fear death which is a very natural process. Nobody knows where we go after death. Though everything is written in Bhagavad Gita, people still have doubts about it. When we have doubt about something and unclear then we should definitely fear because it is similar to a Bus Trip where we don't know where the bus is going, but we have the right to inquire about the destination of the bus in which we are the only passenger and we alone come and alone go from this world. Every money, car, luxury items, etc we have accumulated just stay here and people forget us after a few days of mourning.</p>

	<p>My quest was to find a way I could be happy all the time. I read all the articles on the Internet and saw a ton of videos. You simply cannot imagine instead of studying for exams I was searching the Internet to find happiness and satisfaction in life because I saw people form ages suffering their life instead of having all the luxuries they have. I just didn't want any of those. I wanted a solution where I could be happy at every moment of my life and it should not be affected by Money, Car, etc that I have or not have. I simply wanted to be happy. I realized that materialistic things are not worthwhile working so much hard for. Instead working simple and easy to just survive and be happy with life was the thing that fascinated me. But Whatever was my thinking, The time plays it part and it kept on pushing me through various stages of my life, and through these stages, I observed one thing. Whenever I was extremely happy something bad happened to me. Whenever I tried to pursue something deeper with the bottom of my heart, Like a 200 M race in my school something bad happened. In the initial stages of success, I was thrashed by the universe and my dreams got swept away in the waves, and was left Unhappy. When I was in 5th grade I participated in a School Race competition there in the first 3 rounds I was a tough runner and I also beat one of the fastest runners of those times in my school. I was extremely happy and filled with ego and overconfidence. Right after some time when the finals were there, I met an accident where I suffered injuries in my Knee and pshhh that dream went by. Similarly, when I fixed my gaze on one target, I was not able to pursue it. I was mad all the time. I enjoyed playing cricket in my backfield instead of going to school and studying nonsense that was not going to help me in my future.I got mad at various things but I didn't get any of them. I was totally disappointed with life and there seemed an unclear future. I always wondered about life. </p>

	<h3>Runing as my Passion</h3>
	<p>In my 6th Class, I was gifted a computer by my daddy and then all the sports activities were just gone because I was totally into this superhuman machine. I was mostly playing computer games and was less physical and so life went on as this and time passed. I opted for computer science and was taught Java as my first programming language. I loved it. Now I got in my 10th grade. I started getting acidity and heartburn problems. I told my family about this but they ignored stating that you are so young and it doesn't happen to youngsters. So I suffered that too. In my class, one of my teachers named Panwar Sir told us that when we sweat, NaCl is flushed out of the body and I related somehow that acid is HCl in the stomach and Cl is bad here so somehow I need to get it out of my system. Now from that moment after coming home. I focused on sweating as much as I can through various physical activities like running and jogging and similarly, I realized that I was very good at it and so my old athletic memories came back and I was happy about that. I discovered my passion for running and so now I was running many times a week. Now again Universe plotted against me and I suffered numerous injuries so I was also not consistent in running also. Side by side I was creating websites, blogs doing SEO, and all the things to bring traffic to my websites and I was enjoying those things too. Right from my 10th grade, I started making some small amount of money from these things and I was happy to earn at such an early age. I was now mad at money and all I wanted was hell a lot of money. I got too egoistic which was not good for me.</p>

	<p>Due to my passion for running and web development, I was not giving time into my studies and so my academic performance degraded but I anyways cared less about it. I got okay marks in High School and Intermediate and joined Graphic Era Deemed University to study Information Technology and completed it in 2018 and in the final year I got a job in Dehradun.</p>

	<h3>No Happiness</h3>
	<p>During these phases, I got everything one needs but something was always missing. I was not happy. Every day waking up going to college studying nonsense :( ( apart from coding :) )  and then when I got into a job again same nonsense. I was just not happy. I got appraisals promotions, I was building excellent products, I was cycling and doing stuff but still, I was unhappy. There was a big void. I just wanted a permanent solution. I tried all the things like staying happy for no reason. But the mind is such a bad monkey it broke my determination of keeping myself happy all the time. I observed that people don't make us sad, happy, angry, etc but it is we who make ourselves these things. With the right amount of intelligence, we can keep our minds in a pleasant mood. It is simple in saying but practically it seemed impossible, the clutches of Maya are so powerful in this Kali Yuga that it will break your will power, determination, confidence, etc all the positive qualities in seconds.</p>

	<h3>Starting the Hare Krishna Mahamantra Chanting</h3>
	<p>Right since my birth, Daily I used to do Puja, like aartis and chanting Hanuman Chalisa and I was determinant in these activities, I always prioritized these activities over things like an exam, I was ready to be late in an exam for 15 minutes but I was never ready to leave my daily Puja because I believed that God has given me everything and exam is just a petty thing. It was not about making God unhappy but it was because I was so much grateful to him. I was able to get all the necessities in life. When I was in school my brother was in college, He was at home on vacations and we discussed ISKCON where he told me there were people form most prestigious colleges like IIT's who left there highly paying jobs and became brahmacharis spreading the message of Bhagavad Gita. I was simply not able to absorb this thing. I scratched my head after hearing this. I wondered how can you live like this, simply because I projected life like this since my birth, I didn't know the other side of the coin, I was unaware of soul, just knew the word where we laughed about it.  </p>

	<p>When next time my brother came home in his vacation he brought Japa beads along with him. It was the first time then I chanted the Hare Krishna Mahamantra, I did 2 rounds and felt nothing. So I left it ( my biggest mistake ), I was then into my usual aarti and Hanuman Chalisa. So time went by and then question arose in my mind that something is not right because If I am doing worship for such a long time, It should develop good qualities in me, I always asked God for these things and said that I can get anything in this world which people ask god like I want that girl, car, money, etc but I just wanted the good qualities because I knew if I get those qualities my life will be blissful automatically. So now again time passed by everything was the same and  I needed some change.</p>

	<h3>Beginning of chanting Hare Krishna mahamantra</h3>
	<p>I was just stumbling around the internet when I discovered the ISKCON devotees' message and their blogs, videos, etc where they told the benefits of the 4 rules they follow for a blissful life. I saw them happy, dancing, etc. I just knew I want this. I was a vegetarian since the beginning ( my biggest luck ), and I was given pure sattvic food, as my mom is a Vaishnav and is a pure Lord Vishnu devotee, and other rules seemed okay to me. So anyhow I started chanting. I will give other details in another post where I will share my experience of the chanting of this Mantra. Anyways I have created <a href="https://adityasaini.in/hare-krishna-mahamantra-counter/" target="_blank">Hare Krishna maha-mantra Counter</a> which people can use using their mic of a laptop, phone, etc in preferably chrome browser and count their chants in case they forget their beads.</p>
