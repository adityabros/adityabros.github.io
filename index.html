      <h2>About Aditya Saini</h2>
      <p>Hello Everyone, I am a Full Stack Developer. My passion for programming started when I started learning it in the 8th grade.</p>

        <p>I learned Java during my school days and C and C++ in College. Competitive Programming is one sport I like to play during free hours and when I am not at work. It helps me rejuvenate my mind and improve my problem-solving skills and the capability to quickly use the brain to solve a new complex problem with the right kind of data structure.</p>
        
        <p>Other than programming, I have hobbies like Yoga, Meditation, Swimming, and Running. I like to meet new people and work in a team with a variety of people who help my growth in each corner.</p>
        
        <p>I am currently working as a Software Engineer 2 at Hashedin by Deloitte,  located in Bengaluru, Karnataka, India. Python and Django are two technologies in which I have excellent Experience.</p>
        
        <p>I like making new connections, so do connect with me on LinkedIn.</p>
        
        
        <p>In my spare time, I like to work on upgrading my technical skills whether it is Coding or Designing or stuff related to that, and management skills so that I am better at handling work and distributing it among my subordinates which will help me in my personal and professional life. </p>

         <p>I like practicing problems on Leetcode, GeeksForGeeks, and Codechef. I write about solutions to various problems on my <a href="https://adityasaini.in/blog/" target="_blank">blog</a> , feel free to go through it, Have a very nice day ahead.</p>

        <h2 >Aditya Saini Background</h2>
        <p>I am from Dehradun, The City of Love in Uttrakhand, India. I went to St.Jude's School, Dehradun, and completed my High School and Intermediate education from there in 2014. I went for an undergraduate Bachelor of Technology in Information Technology and passed out from there in 2018.</p>

<p>I started working as a Full Stack Developer in Blue Water Trade Winds Pvt. Ltd which is a marine tech company based in Dehradun in March 2018 when I was in my final semester(8th). I grabbed the opportunity in this lovely company from Internshala where I noticed an opening where Blue Water was hiring a software developer who knew Python and Mysql, I went for the interview and there met my first manager who took my technical round which I was able to pass. I  was interviewed for 3 more rounds where they assessed my Psychological capability and mindset to check whether I was a good team player or not, that too went well, and then in the final round, I met my  Boss who was such a nice person. He gave me the job and then I started working there. </p>

<p>Initially, I was involved in writing various types of complex python scripts which I used to solve marine industry-related software programming challenges. It was such a different experience because the marine industry and software were two fields that are less heard of because mostly you will hear about software engineering being used in tech industries like Facebook, Twitter, Uber, etc but it was a different experience altogether. </p>

<p>I handled the Backend and Frontend. Most of the modules I developed from scratch, working in Blue Water allowed me to take full responsibility for my work which helped in developing the skills necessary to be a software developer. I saw the company grow and become a famous firm in the shipping industry known for its professional maritime solutions. After working for almost 3 and a half years my journey came to an end for Blue Water.</p>

<p>I started working in Hashedin By Deloitte in September 2021 and went through their initial advanced training for developers which prepares them for the journey ahead. </p>

<p>In Hashedin I joined a big team that allowed me to work in big environments and handle stuff in that way. My Management skills have increased significantly here. I got experience in Data Science and Web Development in a great way. Currently, I am working on a web dev project and it is helping me a lot in advance in my career.</p>

<p>I am trying to learn Kannada and hoping to become fluent in it, I always wanted to learn more languages and Kannada would be very good for me to start with because it is one of the ancient languages and can be used for day-to-day life in Bengaluru city. </p>

<p>I wish everyone who is reading this Good Health, Peace, and Prosperity in Life, Best of Luck for all of your future Endeavours. Hope to meet you someday and have a chat:).</p>
