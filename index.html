      </ul>
      <p> My Primary skill is <b>Python</b> which I extensively use in the work that I do throughout the Day at Office or whether it is competitive programming. Django is the web framework which I use to power my web app if I am developing one, Apart from that other powerful tool that give boost to my skill is Javascript which helps me in handling the frontend part and which forms the basis of web frameworks like Angular, React, etc which is very good</p>

      <p>Data Structures and Algorithms is another thing which is my power which I use to power my problem solving skills to solve a lot of problems at Work and also in competitive programming. It also helps me refresh my mind whenver I get bore with the usual stuff I switch on to CP to challenge my brain to get out of comfort zone.</p>

      <h3>1.Maritime Visual</h3>
      <p>It is one of the most interesting project on which I have worked on. It is related to <b>maps</b>. Objective of this project was to <b>visualize the whole marine activity </b> which is going on around the <b>world </b> whether it's <b>Wind, pressure, Well, Wave height and various weather factors and the Ships that are enrolled in our system</b>.</p>

      <p>Getting <b>all the data</b> which is required by a mariner at once place was a big relief for the clients of our product as the only thing which he needed to see was the page of this module as then he was able to <b>visualize the whole activity of his fleet along with Historical(past) tracks of his vessel and also the future paths which were recommended by BOSS (Core Product of the firm for which I work )</b>.</p>

      <p>This project has solved the problem of many mariners as they got all the naval stuff they needed at once place.</p>

      <p>The main power which we used to develop this awesome product is <b>Leaflet Maps</b> which is an Open Source Map library which is competitive to google maps though they are free but they provide almost all features as a map instead of being free which is also supported by the Open source community.</p>
