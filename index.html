      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>Hello, My name is Aditya Saini and I am a Full Stack Developer. My passion in programming started since it was taught me in my 8th grade and since then I am writing beautiful programs and efficient algorithms that solves various complex problems.</h5>

      <p>I love competitive programming and that is what I do when I am free.Connect with Me on LinkedIn, Facebook, etc. I love to talk to people and discuss about the growing tech in our world.</h5>

      </ul>
      <p> My Primary skill is <b>Python</b> which I extensively use in the work that I do throughout the Day at Office or whether it is competitive programming. Django is the web framework which I use to power my web app if I am developing one, Apart from that other powerful tool that give boost to my skill is Javascript which helps me in handling the frontend part and which forms the basis of web frameworks like Angular, React, etc which is very good</p>

      <p>Data Structures and Algorithms is another thing which is my power which I use to power my problem solving skills to solve a lot of problems at Work and also in competitive programming. It also helps me refresh my mind whenver I get bore with the usual stuff I switch on to CP to challenge my brain to get out of comfort zone.</p>

      <h1>Projects</h1>
      
      <h3>1.Maritime Visual</h3>
      <p>It is one of the most interesting project on which I have worked on. It is related to <b>maps</b>. Objective of this project was to <b>visualize the whole marine activity </b> which is going on around the <b>world </b> whether it's <b>Wind, pressure, Well, Wave height and various weather factors and the Ships that are enrolled in our system</b>.</p>

      <p>Getting <b>all the data</b> which is required by a mariner at once place was a big relief for the clients of our product as the only thing which he needed to see was the page of this module as then he was able to <b>visualize the whole activity of his fleet along with Historical(past) tracks of his vessel and also the future paths which were recommended by BOSS (Core Product of the firm for which I work )</b>.</p>

      <p>This project has solved the problem of many mariners as they got all the naval stuff they needed at once place.</p>

      <p>The main power which we used to develop this awesome product is <b>Leaflet Maps</b> which is an Open Source Map library which is competitive to google maps though they are free but they provide almost all features as a map instead of being free which is also supported by the Open source community.</p>

      <h3>2.MIRROR</h3>
      <p>As the name suggest, this project does a similar kind of job, it mirrorizes the data from the ship into our servers. The need of the system arose as Ship masters used to send various kind of marine data using Excel Sheets and it took a good amount of data and as they have limitations on ship.</p>
      <p>Mirror paved a way for masters to reduce their data consumption by 90 % as it only required an email to be sent from their system into our servers and the job was done</p>
      <p>It is an Offline system system which only requires internet connection to transmit data and whole process is offline from the Ship side.</p>
      <p>It consists of a well programmed HTML file that has latest capabilities and visuals which is also fascinating for the ship captain as earlier the excel sheet also looked boring.All types of reports for which there were different excel sheets earlier are now in a single file</p>
      <p>After generating data , Ship master needs to send data through an email and our mails are automatically read by our programs which parses the email and scans the mail for ambiguity and submits the data into system.</p>

      <h3>3.Qaira</h3>
      <p>An AI based chatbot that helped us reduce the user time consumption by 74%.</p>
      <p>Earlier user had to navigate through the whole system to get various kinds of data. Through the help of our chatbot, He is now only required to ask the thing he wants and our system returns the output in a couple of seconds , saving a lot of time of the user.</p>
      <p>From getting the Data regarding a ship or its latest position, seeing the Historical track or the recommended route from BOSS user just needs to ask Qaira for that and whoof! in a couple of seconds he gets what he wants, thus saving time.</p>
      
      <h3>4.Suspicious User Detector</h3>
      <p>Spam protection is something that every system should has , as nobody knows what could happen next and similar thing happened at our firm when we were in a similar kind of situation</p>
      <p>A lot of trafic was coming from a single IP address and it was requesting a very cruical page which is the heaviest in our system and does a lot of calculation. It was not causing an Issue but was quite normal and similar attacks from multiple servers could have caused something</p>
      <p>So I designed my own approach to solve this problem using Leaky Bucket Algorithm to log out a user that seemed abnormal but before that he was warned too ! just to confirm if he is a genuine person or a automatic bot doing the job of a spammer </p>

      <h3>5.Marine Data Validator</h3>
      <p>This is one of the key internal products for our Operation team as there is a lot of Data which makes no sense and is ambiguos</p>
      <p>It generally happens through Human erros and sometimes faulty machine equipments </p>
      <p>To filter out the good data, I designed the system using a wide range of parameters and intelligent models that has the capability to detect ambiguity in the Data</p>
      <p>Apart from detecting Ambiguity we have our own Error Log system that is cruicial for our operation team to take actions based on the data we received which helps us to run our processes smooothly.</p>
