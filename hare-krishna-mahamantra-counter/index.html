		<p><b>This application works best in Desktop Google Chrome</b>, so please avoid Mobile Google Chrome as there are some bugs in Web Speech API which causes errors in Counting of the mantra, This Application was designed so that people can count their Hare Krishna Maha Mantra chants. Sometimes people may not have their beads or some other issue so in that case they can use this Hare Krishna maha mantra counter to fill the gap and chant and be blissful.</p>

		<h4>Why Chant Hare Krishna Hare Rama Mantra ?</h4>
		<p>It is written in the vedas that for Kali Yuga Hare Krishna Maha Mantra is the easiest and simplest method to achieve self realization. It destroys all the evil effects of Kaliyuga which are anxiety,depression,laziness,guilt,fear,uneasy mind,sadness,lust,greed,anger, etc all negative qualities that distances us from god. So chanting this mantra will help us be in association with God.</p>
		<p>As per Kali Santaran Upanishad, When Dwapar Yuga was about to end, Sage Narada went to Lord Brahma and asked him how can one overcome negative effects of Kali Yuga ( present age ).</p>
		<p>To this question, Lord Brahma told sage narada that you have asked a good question which is benefitting for Humans, Lord Brahma told that there is one secret mantra which was kept hidden by all the Vedas, to this sage narad asked about the mantra.</p>
		<p>Lord Brahma then told the mantra <i>hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare</i></p>
		<p>and told Narada that these mantra destroys the 16 envelopments in which jiva(human) is entagled which is a kind of bondage which binds Jiva to Maya and prevents him from realizing God, so chanting this mantra is the best remedy for present age and one who will chant this mantra significantly can even come out of very severe sins.</p>
		<p>Famous spiritual organisations like ISKCON promotes chanting of this mantra, some people have raised the question that in shastras Rama name was written before Krishna so hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare was before hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare and it has been reversed, so this is a long debate but many people who have chanted this mantra either way have told about the same benefits each got. </p>
		
		<h4>Mantra helping in coming out of Addiction</h4>
		<p>Many devotees in ISKCON society have come out of their intoxication problems which they earlier use to do before joining ISKCON and becoming a devotee, so this mantra had positive impact on them. Lets hope it works same way for us as well so that we are blessed by God.</p>
